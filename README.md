# GsMtgJson - GAS for generating Google Sheets to track Magic collections

This was the first version of a spreadsheet generator that builds/updates
Magic: the Gathering collection management spreadsheets.

It is very slow, taking ~30 minutes to create or update a spreadsheet and
requires some degree of manual intervention. The code is kind of a mess
and really requires that you know what is going on.

# This project is dead!

Go use [Version 2](https://github.com/gwax/mtg_ssm) instead.

Version 2 is much faster, easier to use, and more reliable. It is a full
Python rewrite that generates XLSX spreadsheets.
